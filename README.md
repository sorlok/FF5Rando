# FF5Rando
Trying to get FF5PR to randomize

## Directories

* MyFF5Plugin - Contains a BepInEx plugin that mods FF5 on the fly to do what we want it to do. Currently (maybe) requires Magicite + asset export, but the goal is to do that internal to the plugin as well.
* Scripts - Various Python scripts that analyze resources from the game and help with the process of randomization. This requires a Magicite export of game assets.
